# Black-Box-Test-Design-Techniques
A comprehensive software testing assignment demonstrating Black-Box Test Design Techniques such as Boundary Value Analysis, Equivalence Partitioning, State Transition Testing, and Decision Table Testing with detailed test cases.

# 🧪 Black-Box Test Design Techniques

## 📄 Overview
This project demonstrates the application of **Black-Box Test Design Techniques** used in Software Quality Assurance. It includes practical examples and test cases for different testing strategies, focusing on input validation, state transitions, and decision-based logic.

---

## 🧠 Techniques Covered
1. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**  
   Tests system behavior at the edge of input boundaries.

2. **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)**  
   Divides input data into valid and invalid partitions to minimize redundant tests.

3. **State Transition Testing (STT)**  
   Verifies system behavior during state changes (e.g., login attempts).

4. **Decision Table Testing (DTT)**  
   Ensures all possible rule combinations are tested for a grading system scenario.
